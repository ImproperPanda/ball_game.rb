An exercise in "moving" an object through a virtual plane

This code is quite simple. The code creates a "ball" object that can move along an X, Y axis and has a set amount of moves.

I wrote the code because I am currently writing a game where a Hero moves through a dungeon and fights monsters. In order to do that I first needed to understand how to "move" in the virtual dungeon.
